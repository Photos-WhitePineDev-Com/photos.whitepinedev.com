Went on an epic ride today.  The forests and mountains were amazing.  And the roads were nearly empty.  Highway 1 was fun but my favorite was riding through the forests in Mt Tamalpais state park.  The old bunkers and gun emplacements on the north side of the entrance of the bay were fun to explore as well.
