Launch from Horsehoe at 6:30.  Under the gate was a little choppy but we caught the last half of the ebb out to Pt Bonita.  Swells were small.  2 to 4 feet so we were able to hug the coast and went to the east of bird rock through a tight slot.  Almost hit a rock but made it through.  On the way back one of us did the arch by the Pt Bonita arch and we got a nice light misting from an incoming cloud front made it back at slack.  Saw a big sea lion at the gate swallowing some fish.  Wasn&rsquo;t afraid of us at all and came right up to us</p>
